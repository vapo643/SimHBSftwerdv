# Simpix Credit Management System

## Overview
Simpix is a full-stack TypeScript application for comprehensive credit management, streamlining the credit proposal workflow from creation and analysis to payment processing and formalization tracking. It aims to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform for financial institutions, focusing on banking-grade security, compliance, and efficient data management to become a leading solution in the credit management market.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Focus: CCB template generation over UI visualization.
Language: Portuguese, studying software architecture.
Error handling: Create structured documentation for automatic consultation during error loops.
**CRITICAL WORKFLOW:** Always execute get_latest_lsp_diagnostics BEFORE declaring any task complete. Never say "pronto" with LSP errors > 0. Follow ESTRATEGIA_ZERO_MICRO_ERROS.md protocol to avoid the 80/20 pattern (80% working, 20% fixing micro errors).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
