# Soft Delete Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive soft delete implementation across the Simpix Credit Management System to meet financial compliance requirements.

## Implementation Date
January 31, 2025

## Compliance Requirement
Financial institutions require complete audit trails of all deletion operations. Hard deletes violate compliance requirements by permanently removing data that may be needed for regulatory audits.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Added `deleted_at` timestamp columns to all critical tables:
- ✅ `parceiros` - Partners table
- ✅ `lojas` - Stores table
- ✅ `produtos` - Products table
- ✅ `tabelas_comerciais` - Commercial tables
- ✅ `propostas` - Proposals table
- ✅ `profiles` - User profiles table

### 2. Audit Log Table
Created `audit_delete_log` table to track all deletion operations:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_delete_log (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  record_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  deleted_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  additional_data JSONB
);
```

### 3. Storage Layer Updates
Updated all delete methods to use soft delete:
- ✅ `deleteLoja()` - Sets deleted_at timestamp
- ✅ `deleteProposta()` - Sets deleted_at timestamp
- ✅ `deletarProduto()` - Sets deleted_at timestamp
- ✅ DELETE endpoints for parceiros - Sets deleted_at timestamp
- ✅ DELETE endpoints for tabelas_comerciais - Sets deleted_at timestamp

### 4. Query Updates
All SELECT queries now filter out soft-deleted records using `isNull(deleted_at)`:
- ✅ `getLojas()` - Filters deleted stores
- ✅ `getLojaById()` - Excludes deleted stores
- ✅ `getPropostas()` - Filters deleted proposals
- ✅ `getPropostaById()` - Excludes deleted proposals
- ✅ `getPropostasByStatus()` - Filters deleted proposals
- ✅ `buscarTodosProdutos()` - Filters deleted products
- ✅ `getAllParceiros()` - Filters deleted partners
- ✅ `getAllTabelasComerciais()` - Filters deleted commercial tables
- ✅ `checkLojaDependencies()` - Only counts non-deleted dependencies

### 5. API Endpoint Updates
All DELETE endpoints now perform soft deletes:
- ✅ `/api/admin/parceiros/:id` - Soft delete partners
- ✅ `/api/admin/tabelas-comerciais/:id` - Soft delete commercial tables
- ✅ `/api/produtos/:id` - Soft delete products (via controller)
- ✅ `/api/admin/lojas/:id` - Soft delete stores
- ✅ `/api/propostas/:id` - Soft delete proposals

## Security Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: All deletions are tracked with user attribution and timestamps
2. **Data Recovery**: Accidentally deleted data can be recovered by clearing the deleted_at field
3. **Compliance**: Meets financial regulatory requirements for data retention
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Enables investigation of deletion patterns and user behavior
5. **Referential Integrity**: Maintains relationships even after logical deletion

## Performance Considerations

- Added indexes on deleted_at columns for efficient filtering
- Created views for active records to simplify queries
- Minimal performance impact due to indexed columns

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify all SELECT queries exclude soft-deleted records
2. Confirm DELETE operations set deleted_at instead of removing records
3. Test audit log creation for all deletion operations
4. Validate recovery process by clearing deleted_at fields
5. Performance test with large datasets containing many soft-deleted records

## Migration Strategy

1. Run migration script to add deleted_at columns
2. Create audit_delete_log table
3. Update all application code to use soft delete
4. Create database views for active records
5. Add performance indexes

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement scheduled purge of old soft-deleted records (after regulatory period)
2. Add UI for viewing and restoring soft-deleted records
3. Create comprehensive deletion reports for compliance audits
4. Implement cascading soft deletes for related records

## Conclusion

The soft delete implementation is now comprehensive across the entire Simpix system, ensuring complete compliance with financial regulations while maintaining data integrity and providing robust audit trails for all deletion operations.
