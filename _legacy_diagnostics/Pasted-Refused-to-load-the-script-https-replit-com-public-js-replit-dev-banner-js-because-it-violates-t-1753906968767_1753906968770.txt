    at overlay_bundle.js:158:392Understand this errorExplanationUnderstanding the problemThis error "A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined" indicates that your web page is attempting to define a custom HTML element with the tag name mce-autosize-textarea more than once. Custom elements need unique tag names within the document.This often happens when:A JavaScript file that defines this custom element is included multiple times on the page.Different libraries or scripts you are using both attempt to define a custom element with the same name. In this case, mce-autosize-textarea is likely related to a TinyMCE feature or a library that provides an autosizing textarea component, potentially like react-autosize-textarea which is mentioned in the search results as being related to TextareaAutosize [1, 2].Suggested fixTo fix this, you need to identify where the mce-autosize-textarea custom element is being defined and ensure it's only defined once.Check your script includes: Look for multiple <script> tags in your HTML that might be loading the same library or file. Remove any duplicates.Check for conflicting libraries: If you are using different libraries or frameworks, check their documentation to see if they define custom elements and if there are any known conflicts with the mce-autosize-textarea name. You might need to update one of the libraries or find an alternative if there's a conflict.Investigate code defining the element: Search your project's codebase for where customElements.define('mce-autosize-textarea', ...) is being called. Make sure this code is only executed once.SummaryThe error "A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined" means you are trying to define a custom HTML tag with the name mce-autosize-textarea multiple times. The fix involves ensuring that the code defining this custom element is only executed once on your page.Sources and related contenthttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39619https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/textarea-autoresize/Data used to understand this messageConsole messageUse search insteadAI tools may generate inaccurate info that doesn't represent Google's views.

/api/admin/users:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)Understand this errorExplanationUnderstanding the problemThis console message indicates that the browser attempted to load a resource (like an image, script, CSS file, or data from an API) from a server, but the server responded with an HTTP status code of 400 (Bad Request). This means the server couldn't process the request because it perceived an error in what the client (your browser) sent. Common reasons include malformed syntax in the request, invalid data, or a request that doesn't conform to the server's expectations [2, 5].How to verifyYou can verify this by inspecting the network request in the "Network" tab of Chrome DevTools. Find the request that failed with the 400 status code. Examine the request URL, headers, and payload (if applicable) to see what was sent to the server. Compare this information to the expected format or requirements for that specific resource or API endpoint.Suggested fixThe fix depends on the specific reason for the bad request. Here are some common scenarios and how to address them:Malformed URL or invalid characters: Double-check the URL being requested for typos, incorrect encoding, or illegal characters. Ensure it matches the expected format.Incorrect request data (payload): If the request includes a body (like for a POST or PUT request), ensure the data is correctly formatted (e.g., valid JSON) and contains all the required fields with appropriate values. Refer to the API documentation if you are making an API call [1, 4].Invalid headers: Check if the request includes necessary headers (like Content-Type or authorization headers) and that they are correctly formatted and contain valid values.File size limits: If you are uploading a file, the file might be too large for the server to process [2, 3].Corrupted browser cache and cookies: In some cases, clearing your browser's cache and cookies can resolve the issue if they are causing conflicts with the request [2, 3].To implement the fix, you'll need to examine the code that generates the problematic request and make the necessary corrections to the URL, request data, or headers.SummaryA 400 Bad Request error means the server rejected the client's request because it was malformed or invalid. To fix it, inspect the network request in DevTools to understand what was sent and correct the issue in your code, whether it's the URL, request data, or headers.Sources and related contenthttps://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/articles/6015811318167-Fixing-a-400-bad-request-errorhttps://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/400-bad-request/https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-fix-400-bad-request-errorhttps://community.postman.com/t/debugging-400-error-with-the-postman-console/61035https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/400Data used to understand this messageConsole messageReload the page to capture related network request data for this message in order to create a better insight.Use search insteadAI tools may generate inaccurate info that doesn't represent Google's views.
