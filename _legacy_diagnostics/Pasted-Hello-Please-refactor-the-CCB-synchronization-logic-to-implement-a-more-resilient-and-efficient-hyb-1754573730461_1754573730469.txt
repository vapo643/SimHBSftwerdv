Hello. Please refactor the CCB synchronization logic to implement a more resilient and efficient hybrid architecture using Webhooks with a Polling fallback.

The goal is to stop the current high-frequency polling (every 2 minutes) and adopt an event-driven approach as the primary method, using polling only as a safety net.

Here are the required implementation steps:

**1. Create a Webhook Listener Endpoint:**
* Create a new route, for example, `POST /api/webhooks/clicksign`, to receive signing completion events from ClickSign.
* This endpoint must securely validate the incoming request (e.g., using HMAC signature verification).
* Upon successful validation, it should trigger the core logic to process the signed document.

**2. Abstract the Core Document Processing Logic:**
* Take the existing logic from `ccbSyncService.ts` that downloads the signed document, saves it to Supabase Storage, and updates the database.
* Move this logic into a reusable function or method, let's call it `processSignedDocument(proposalId)`.
* Both the new webhook listener and the refactored polling service will call this same function to avoid code duplication.

**3. Refactor the Polling Service (`ccbSyncService.ts`):**
* Change the polling frequency from every 2 minutes to a much lower frequency, such as once every 6 hours.
* Modify the polling query. It should no longer check for all recently signed proposals. Instead, it should act as a safety net, querying only for proposals that are in an "awaiting signature" state for more than a few hours and haven't been processed yet. This will catch any events the webhook might have missed.
* When the polling service finds such a proposal, it should call the same `processSignedDocument(proposalId)` function.

**4. Enhance Logging:**
* Add specific logs to differentiate how a document was processed. For example: `INFO: Document for proposal [ID] processed via Webhook.` or `WARN: Document for proposal [ID] processed via Polling fallback.`.

Please implement these changes to create a more robust and efficient system.
